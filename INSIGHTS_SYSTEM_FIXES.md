# Insights System Caching and Data Reloading Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **DuckDB Connection Management Issues** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Every method call created a new `duckdb.connect(database=':memory:')` connection, causing:
- Memory leaks
- Connection exhaustion
- Inconsistent data states
- Performance degradation

**Solution**: Implemented connection pooling
- Added class-level connection pool with thread-safe access
- Connections are reused across requests for the same data file
- Automatic connection cleanup and reinitialization
- Added `cleanup_connections()` method for periodic maintenance

**Files Modified**:
- `core/utils/parquet_utils.py`: Added connection pooling logic
- `core/signals.py`: Added request cleanup signal handler

### 2. **Inefficient Cache Key Generation** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Cache key used `hash(str(active_filters))` which was inconsistent:
- Same filters could generate different cache keys
- Cache misses even with identical filter combinations
- Unnecessary data reloading

**Solution**: Implemented deterministic cache key generation
- Sort filters by key and value for consistent ordering
- Use JSON serialization with sorted keys
- MD5 hash for consistent, short cache keys
- Only include non-empty filters in cache key

**Files Modified**:
- `core/utils/parquet_utils.py`: Added `generate_cache_key()` method
- `core/views.py`: Updated to use improved cache key generation

### 3. **Immediate Form Submission** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Filters submitted immediately on change, causing:
- Rapid page reloads
- Users couldn't make multiple filter selections
- Poor user experience
- Server overload

**Solution**: Implemented debounced form submission
- 500ms delay before actual form submission
- Loading indicator during debounce period
- Users can make multiple selections before reload
- Improved user experience

**Files Modified**:
- `static/js/shared_filters.js`: Added debouncing logic and loading indicators

### 4. **Service Worker Caching Conflicts** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Service worker cached insights pages but didn't handle filter parameters:
- Users saw stale data when filters changed
- No distinction between base pages and filtered pages
- Cache invalidation issues

**Solution**: Improved service worker cache handling
- Don't cache pages with query parameters (filtered requests)
- Only cache base insights pages without filters
- Always fetch fresh data for filtered requests
- Maintains performance for base pages while ensuring fresh data for filters

**Files Modified**:
- `static/js/preload-worker.js`: Updated fetch event handler

### 5. **No Loading States** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: No visual feedback during data loading:
- Users didn't know if system was working
- Appeared unresponsive during filter changes
- Poor user experience

**Solution**: Added comprehensive loading states
- Loading indicator for filter changes
- Visual feedback during data processing
- Clear indication of system activity
- Improved perceived performance

**Files Modified**:
- `templates/core/commercial_rate_insights_state.html`: Added loading indicator
- `static/js/shared_filters.js`: Added loading state management

## Performance Improvements

### Before Fixes:
- Multiple DuckDB connections per request
- Inconsistent caching (low hit rates)
- Immediate form submissions causing rapid reloads
- Service worker cache conflicts
- No user feedback during loading

### After Fixes:
- Single connection per data file (pooled)
- Consistent caching with high hit rates
- Debounced form submissions (500ms delay)
- Smart service worker caching
- Clear loading states and user feedback

## Testing

### Stress Test Script: `test_insights_stress.py`
Tests the system under load to identify issues:
- Rapid filter changes
- Concurrent users
- Cache consistency
- Memory usage

### Fix Validation Script: `test_insights_fixes.py`
Validates that fixes work correctly:
- Improved cache consistency
- Debounced filtering
- Connection pool efficiency
- Memory usage improvements
- Service worker cache handling

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Tests:

1. **Start the Django server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Run stress tests** (to see issues):
   ```bash
   python test_insights_stress.py
   ```

3. **Run fix validation tests** (to verify improvements):
   ```bash
   python test_insights_fixes.py
   ```

### Expected Results:

- **Cache Hit Rate**: Should be >80% for identical requests
- **Response Time**: Should be <0.2s for cached requests
- **Memory Usage**: Should not increase significantly over time
- **Concurrent Users**: Should handle 10+ concurrent users without issues
- **Filter Changes**: Should be smooth with loading indicators

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Connection Cleanup:
- Automatic cleanup every 10th request
- Manual cleanup available via `ParquetDataManager.cleanup_connections()`
- Monitored via Django signals

### Cache Management:
- 5-minute cache TTL for insights data
- Automatic cache invalidation on data changes
- Consistent cache keys prevent conflicts

### Performance Monitoring:
- Response time logging
- Cache hit rate tracking
- Memory usage monitoring
- Error rate tracking

## Future Improvements

1. **Redis Caching**: Consider Redis for distributed caching
2. **Database Indexing**: Add indexes for frequently filtered columns
3. **Query Optimization**: Optimize DuckDB queries for better performance
4. **CDN Integration**: Use CDN for static assets
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for real-time data updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **High Memory Usage**: Run `ParquetDataManager.cleanup_connections()`
2. **Slow Response Times**: Check cache hit rates and connection pool
3. **Stale Data**: Clear browser cache and service worker cache
4. **Filter Issues**: Check JavaScript console for errors

### Debug Commands:

```python
# Check connection pool status
from core.utils.parquet_utils import ParquetDataManager
print(ParquetDataManager._connection_pool)

# Clean up connections
ParquetDataManager.cleanup_connections()

# Test cache key generation
cache_key = ParquetDataManager.generate_cache_key("GA", {"payer": ["Aetna"]})
print(cache_key)
```

## Conclusion

These fixes address the core issues with caching and data reloading in the insights system:

- ✅ **Performance**: Significant improvement in response times and memory usage
- ✅ **Reliability**: Consistent caching and connection management
- ✅ **User Experience**: Smooth filtering with proper loading states
- ✅ **Scalability**: Better handling of concurrent users
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Clean code with proper error handling

The system should now handle filter changes smoothly without the jumping around and caching issues that were previously experienced.
